# Yahyah Odin's Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, experience, and creative experiments.

I designed this site to not only display my work but also to reflect my personal aesthetic. It features an iridescent theme mixed with glassmorphism and some fun 3D interactivity to bring the experience to life.

## About Me

I'm **Yahyah Odin**, a Junior Computer Science student at **Ateneo de Davao University** in Davao City, PH.

Currently, I serve as the **Associate to the External Vice President** of the CSSEC. My background is a unique mix of everything: a substantial amount of technical production, creative leadership, and student governance. I love sitting at the intersection of design and code—focusing on Frontend Development, UI/UX, and especially Quality Assurance to build smooth, interactive web and application experiences.

## What's Inside?

This project was my playground for refining my skills in **Three.js** and **Framer Motion**. Here are some of the key features I implemented:

* **Bento Grid Layout:** A responsive, modular grid for the landing page that organizes my content cleanly.
* **Iridescent Theme:** A custom light/dark mode system that I tweaked to create a specific atmospheric vibe.
* **Interactive 3D Background:** A procedural particle system running on `react-three-fiber` that reacts to your mouse movement—subtle, but immersive.
* **Smooth Animations:** Seamless page transitions and micro-interactions so navigating feels like using an app, not just a static website.
* **Project Lightbox:** A custom-built modal system for viewing my project galleries with zoom and pan capabilities.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React + Vite
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Material UI (MUI) + Emotion
* **Motion:** Framer Motion
* **3D:** Three.js + React Three Fiber
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
